The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which\\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Data Considerations\\n\\n  The Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\n  Ohio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\n  discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\n  race and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\n  name.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\n  its informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"Itâ€™s not going to\\n  be a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\n  American-themed name.\"\\n\\n  https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  - When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n    should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n    by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n    lower because it is more realistic.\\n  - This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n    applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n    above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n    as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n    that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n    should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n    output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n',\n",

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

A low GAA against good\\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\\nof comparing two goaltenders.\\n\\n\\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\n\\nDon't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either.

Gant is a\\nbig question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and\\nhas rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who\\'s in).  Blauser is a very valuable\\nbat... for a shortstop.\\n\\n\\n\\nWanna bet?  The difference between Lopez\\'s bat and Olson/Berryhill could be\\n20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player\\nwith experience and a player who can play, I\\'ll take the latter every time.\\n\\n\\nJust like Keith Mitchell did?\\n\\n\\nThat was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\\nreally don\\'t understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\\nor some combination of the two.

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----',\n",

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\\n\\nLet\\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\nto the Septuagint.\\n\\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\\'t happened.\\n\\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\nOT, unlike for the NT.',\n",

If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

CRITZ, III\" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM>\\nSubject: EnviroLeague\\n\\n\"Birth Announcement\" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe\\n                       Information Service\\n===================================================================\\n \\n                     FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT\\n                     -------------------\\n \\n                                     (SM)\\n                        EnviroLeague\\n \\nA new youth movement,\"EnviroLeague,\" was recently born, according to its\\nfounder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:\\n       EnviroLeague\\n       P.O.

              "  \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\\nsoftware on these groups:\\n\\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\\n\\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\\n   Generic clients.\\n   Customizable servers.\\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\\n        attached.\\n\\nFunctionality:\\n\\n  Client:\\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\\nand Webster.\\n \\nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\\nby Offerman.\\n \\nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\\n \\nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\\n \\nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\\n \\nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\\n \\nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\\n \\nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\\nscored long before that.\\n \\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\\nof a sophomore jinx year.\\n \\nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.',\n",

Data files should be examined and repaired.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a\\nswap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky\\nstuff in a PC environment.\\n\\n\\nA reasonably accurate prediction...\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s a brief description of how DOS stores files:\\n\\nThere are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,\\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\\n\\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that\\'s not\\nimportant right now.\\n\\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\\ncontains the next section of the file.\\n\\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\\n\\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\\nwhich says it\\'s the last cluster in the file.\\n\\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\\nsubmission.  It doesn\\'t have any intelligence, so you have to\\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\\n\\nNow let\\'s do a bit of a post-mortem:\\n\\n\\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don\\'t match\\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\\nobviously, are made up.))\\n\\n\\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\\n\\n\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that\\nC:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\\n\\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \"Missing pieces\" are\\nlikely to be found in those \"lost chains\" at the top...)\\n\\n\\nYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of\\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\\namount which exceeded available disk space...\\n\\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\\nproblem occurs.

Note the early use of\\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year\\'s papers listed in the\\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\\n\\n-- Eric\\n\\n\\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\\n\\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\\n\\n\\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\\n\\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\\n\\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\\n\\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\\n\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\\n\\n--------\\n\\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\\n\\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\\'s ONLY if you restrict\\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\\nsecond derivative.  (I think there\\'s an \\'89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that\\ndeals with this).\\n\\n--',\n",

              "  \"\\nWales Conference, Adams Division, Semifinal\\n\\nI'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the\\nseries.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal\\n(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely\\n(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one\\nof my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the\\nmatchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.\\n\\n\\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\\n\\nFinal\\n\\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\\ncredit to NY.\\n\\n\\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\\n\\n\\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\\n\\n\\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\\n\\n\\n\\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\\n\\n\\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \\nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\\n\\n\\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \\nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\\n\\n\\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \\nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\\nGretzky.  LA in six.\\n\\n\\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\\n\\n\\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\\n\\n\\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\\n\\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\\nall-round players in the NHL.\\n\\n\",\n",

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

The controller card must\\nuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).\\nWindows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that\\npoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your\\ndisk to index to information in that file.\\n\\ncompressed disks are actually \"logical\" disks.  These disks have different\\ncharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information\\non the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.

Because of this \"inbetween\" program, windows\\ncannot use direct methods to read from the \"logical\" disk.\\n\\na permenant swap file is only there to \"reserve\" an area of the disk that\\nwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically\\nnot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space.

              "  'Archive-name: atheism/logic\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.4\\n\\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\\n\\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"',\n",

Sometimes for the Plus.\\n\\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \\n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\\n\\n\\n\\na) They aren\\'t perfect, but are much improved.  I don\\'t recall the last time which\\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\\n   to software incompatibility.\\n\\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\\n\\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\\n\\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\\n\\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\\n   the old driver.\\n\\n\\n\\na) It\\'s quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\\n \\nb) Yes - I\\'ll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\\n   every 20 minutes or so...\\n\\nc) Depends on many many things.\\n\\n\\n\\na) I like it.\\n\\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\\n\\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\\n\\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \\n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \\n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\\n\\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\\n \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThat is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this\\ngroup so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar\\nwith the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don\\'t have\\nan Graphics Ultra yet.)\\n\\nATI Graphics Ultra Plus:\\n- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours\\n- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600\\n- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)\\n  Stretch full motion video windows to full size\\n- Fast VGA\\n- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)\\n- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)\\n- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop\\n- Around a 1/2 length card size\\n- Priced from $400 U.S.\\n\\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro:\\n- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus\\n- Faster performance with VRAMS\\n- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced\\n- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel\\n- Priced from $600 U.S.\\n\\nATI Technologies\\n(416) 756-0718\\n\\nI hope this summary can be of use to you.\\n\\nAl\\n\\nP.S.

              "  '\\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.',\n",

              "  \"\\nI am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\n",

But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n',\n",

Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what\\nhappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never\\nhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan\\nof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. \\n\\nIt was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie\\nat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting\\nin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of \\ntheir own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the \\ngoaltender, or whatever.\\n\\nAnd to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only\\nsay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.\\nThere was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late\\nin the third period of the 7th game of the second round.

Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you\\'d have knee surgery\\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \\n\\n\\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \\n\\n\\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n\\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It\\'s difficult to predict, but do you think\\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\\nwill maintain their attendance levels?

              "  'This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.

              "  '\\n\\tOh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN\\'T marginal?\\n\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.  It\\'s an interesting subject.  Here\\'s an off\\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF\\'ers from each team.  I probably\\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

Notes\\n========\\n(Excerpted from the FAQ article)\\n\\nPlease do *not* post or mail messages saying \"I can\\'t FTP, could\\nsomeone mail this to me?\"  There are a number of automated mail servers\\nthat will send you things like this in response to a message.\\n\\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\n3.

On the other hand, I expect him to\\nrelease Otto if he doesn\\'t turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,\\nOtto\\'s game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out\\na problem with the method since Otto\\'s performance was infinitely bad,\\nand excruciatingly prolonged.)\\n\\n\\nI think Merced\\'s rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren\\'t you willing to\\ngive him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting\\nso gloomy?\\n\\n\\nNo he didn\\'t.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when\\nthe league finally realizes this, it won\\'t be pretty at all.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which\\nwas a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.\\nMeanwhile, I\\'m not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a\\nsix-year free agent before the 1992 season.\\n\\n\\nTwice through the rotation, and you\\'ve given up?  Yikes.\\n\\n\\nBut so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life\\nof a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can\\'t be much longer than a year.\\n\\n\\nBut he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his\\ndisastrous 1992.  I don\\'t think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign\\nhim.\\n\\n\\nHe certainly wasn\\'t last year.\\n\\n\\nHey, that\\'s the \"Skates Smith\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires\\nLonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is\\na real weirdo.\\n\\n\\nIf that\\'s the goal of the team ownership, than I don\\'t see why Sauer\\ngets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don\\'t know what he has or\\nhasn\\'t said about revenue sharing, so I can\\'t comment there.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them\\nto retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think\\nbigger accomplishments of Simmons\\' tenure were getting some value for\\nJohn Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch\\nlast year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something\\nin 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement\\nparts, which means that even if fail it hasn\\'t done serious damage to\\nthe Bucs\\' future.\\n\\n\\nDoes this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I\\nnever heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on\\nthis?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don\\'t know who to\\nblame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I\\n*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his\\nwillingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is\\npointed at his feet.\\n\\n(btw--I\\'ve wondered whether my latest posts have been getting\\noff-site, so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can see\\nthis, would he drop me a short note?)',\n",

Here\\'s a very simele question to which\\nI\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com',\n",

He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  '\\nWhat do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by \"omnipotent\"\\nthat God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates\\na self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively\\nuseless.\\n\\nTo be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \"being all-powerful\" and\\nnot \"being able to do anything/everything\".\\n\\nLet me illustrate by analogy.\\nSuppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose\\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily \"omnipotent\".\\n\\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\\n\\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \\nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \\nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do \"whatever it wanted\".\\nThe US would simply \"never want to interfere\" for such an idea would\\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\\nnon-interference policy.\\n\\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\\nHe, Himself is.\\n\\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\\nomnipotence.\\n\\nRegards,',\n",

              "  \"\\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\\ntickets next season:-).\",\n",

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE?

              "  'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\\nSince he isn\\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n',\n",

But\\nAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.\\nThat is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long\\nas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a\\nconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to\\ngive him that dreaded \"seasoning\".\\n\\n\\nSorry.  New.  Don\\'t know Nichols\\' Law.  Don\\'t believe in catchers\\'\\nera.

Baseball\\nis a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping\\nLopez on the farm then that\\'s what the Braves *should* do.\\n\\nI happen to believe that it\\'s a baseball decision.  While you from\\nyour armchair may disagee, I don\\'t.  I think there is a lot of\\nevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among\\nlarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I\\nthink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly\\nmore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have\\nreleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It\\nmay also be logical.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.

Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

              "  '#21\\tPETER AHOLA\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\\n\\n#24\\tDOUG WILSON\\t\\tSeason: 16th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\\n\\t\\t2nd round pick in \\'92 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\\nwill go down in Scremin\\'s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.',\n",

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\\n##it)?  \\n##\\n\\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\\nscience.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into\\nyour mouth either). \\n\\n   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can\\nnot make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.\\n\\n   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to\\nbe scientific treatises.

              "  '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.',\n",
              "  'The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\\nKevin Dineen\\'s 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\\nLaFontaine all night.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\\nscratch.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-McGill\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\\nrole scouting if Farwell didn\\'t want him back.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t40 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t74 1992-93\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tMark Recchi\\t121 1992-93*\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t52 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\n*More than 80 games.\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t121\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t84\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t62\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t59\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...',\n",

First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!!

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.

And I think I should refer all questions\\nto her and to the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\\nshould be executed?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Is this a raid?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\\ndecisions.\\n\\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\\nmorning?\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\\n\\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\\nMitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to\\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good\\nabout it.\\n\\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\\n\\n                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT\\n\\n -30-\\n',\n",

YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!).

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\\n\\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\\n\\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\\ncan say nothing about it.)\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\\n\\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\\n\\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\\n\\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.\",\n",
